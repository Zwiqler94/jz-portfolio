      "It was June 2020, I was really depressed and anxious about the pandemic and it's effect on what I was doing for work and on my social life. I was living at home with my parents, whom I love, but we sometimes have difficulty beingon top of each other especially during lockdowns. My mom noticed how lousy I was feeling and she told me I could get a dog in hopes that it would ease my mind.  I've always wanted a dog since I had to say goodbye to my childhood pooch, Teddy. He was    a majestic white Standard Poodle, a really great dog and everyone on my block loved him.  I was thrilled with the news and began researching breeders. Around October 2020, I found  a breeder and put a deposit down for a poodle puppy. By then, I had moved out of my parents house and  things had gotten better at work, but I was still determined to get my poodle. I believe it'll be great for my mental health. The puppy was suppposed to be born around February time, but the mother never got pregnant and I was really disappointed.  The breeder let me know that this summer she was going to breed again, so I've been waiting Today, June 2nd, I got word that the mother was being bred and the puppies should be on their way in about 8/9 weeks.  I'm so excited! Hopefully, which ever puppy belongs to me will be coming home with me Sept/Oct time!",
